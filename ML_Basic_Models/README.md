# Basic Machine Learning Models

This subfolder contains some of my implementations of basic machine learning models.
I did these to refresh the foundational knowledge that I have been taught at university. For all of the mini-projects I used appropriate sklearn datasets.

Included are:
- kNN Model
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
